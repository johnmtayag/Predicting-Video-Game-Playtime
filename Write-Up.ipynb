    "## User Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The base user dataset has 88,310 rows with no missing values. Each user row contains a list of items that the user interacted with - these items consist mainly of video games, though there are other forms of media available as well, such as video/audio production tools. For each item, the number of hours played total and the number of hours played within the last two weeks are provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "After processing, the base user-item interaction dataset extracted from the base user dataset has over 5 million rows of data, so in order to reduce the computational needs for certain algorithms, a few actions were taken. First, a random sample of 20,000 users were extracted from the user dataset. Then, after extracting the interaction data, a random sample of 850,000 interactions were extracted. The dataset was then further reduced to exclude users with fewer than 3 interactions or have 0 total playtime - since the ultimate task is to predict a user's playtime for a given game, these users would not have enough data to create meaningful predictions. Additionally, all duplicate interactions were removed from the dataset.\n",

    "#### Owning vs Playing\n",
    "\n",
    "Most users in this reduced dataset own many games, with the mean at 58 games and the median at 33 games, even after limiting the number of interactions. The maximum number of games owned is extremely high at 5588 games, and there are 1028 users who own enough games to be high outliers. The distribution of the number of games owned per user is highly right-skewed, with 75% of the users owning fewer than 68 games. When limiting the analysis to only games that each user has played, the numbers are much lower - the mean number of games played is 37, with the median at 23, and the distribution is slightly less right-skewed.\n",

    "Most games in this dataset have many owners, as the mean number of owners is 87. However, the distribution is significantly more right-skewed with the median number of owners at 12, and with 75% of all games having fewer than 47. Additionally, there are 1394 high outliers, with the maximum number of users at 7423. When limiting the analysis to only owners who have actually played each game, the numbers are also generally lower - the mean number of players is 67, with the median at 7. Unlike the user distribution though, the distribution of players vs owners is fairly similar.\n",

Another very interesting thing to note is that the most common tags actually have a lot of overlap with the most common genres. While I don't believe this feature will be a great predictor due to its distribution, it will be interesting to confirm if that is indeed the case.\n",

    "Although many of the users in this dataset own hundreds of games, many of these games have actually not been played. By accurately predicting how long a given user will play a specific game, one can build a personalized recommendation system that can present a selection of games that is catered to a specific user's taste based on their typical playstyle. These recommendations can be for games not currently owned by the user, or they can be for games owned by the user but which have not yet been played. The first system would be more typical of a recommender system which identifies new games to play, while the second system would help encourage users to play games they already own.\n"

    "\n",
    "Memory-based collaborative filtering are a class of recommender system techniques which estimate some query interaction based on similarity measures calculated using past user-item interactions. For example, one could estimate how user A will rate movie B based on how user A rated movies similar to movie B. To implement this style of recommender system, one needs to provide a similarity metric as well as some kind of framework as to how the similarity metric will be used to generate predictions.\n",

Likewise, when the similarity is based on items, then the calculation is based on the similarity between the query item and other items interacted with by the query user. However, many users and items have thousands of interactions each, so in order to reduce the computational overhead for this task, the similarity between users was limited to 151 random item interactions, while the similarity between items was limited to 115 random user interactions. These values are statistical cutoffs calculated via the IQR method ($1.5*IQR + Q3$) where values above the cutoff are likely outliers.\n",

This implementation focuses on how much the user's rating deviates from the average rating that the item receives to get a better sense of how much the user \"likes\" the similar item compared to others.

    "#### Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Though one of the simpler model classes, the models utilizing the Jaccard similarity and binary cosine similarity functions performed decently well. On the other hand, the numeric similarity functions performed quite poorly, especially the model utilizing the Pearson similarity function. This is likely due to the large discrepancies in playtime values between different games and users. Additionally, the numeric cosine similarity and Pearson correlation similarity functions assume that the target values align with the user/item preferences, but that might not necessarily be true for video game playtimes. While some games are quite short, others are extremely long, with some games technically not having an \"ending,\" such as live-service games like Genshin Impact and MMORPGs like Runescape and World of Warcraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the numeric similarity functions required significantly longer training times than the binary variations, even after limiting the number of interactions to include in the similarity calculations. If the algorithm considered all possible interactions, the MSE/MAE may lower, but at a massive cost in computational requirements as certain users and items had thousands of recorded interactions in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final consideration is that some of the collaborative filtering models required a long training time to calculate similarity values. If the training data were to be updated, then the model must be trained again, so these models are quite inefficient for situations requiring live model updates.\n",

    "#### Latent Factor Model (LFM) vs Factorization Machine (FM)\n",
    "\n",
    "The LFM and the FM had very similar performance, especially in regard to minimizing the MSE, though when tuned properly, the FM outcompetes the LFM However, this increase in performance comes at a great training time cost due to the large number of computations required to update exponentially more parameters. The latent factor model without any additional features converged to a great solution in just 200 seconds while the fastest FM model which utilized a single genre feature took just over 700 seconds. Additionally, in order to maximize the potential of the FM, the hyperparameters need to be tuned, and the included features need to be carefully selected. With my choice of OHE genre and tag columbn, there was some slight performance improvements in overall MSE and some noticeable improvements in the MSE for users and items with fewer interactions. However, the LFM had incredible performance in comparison, and in fact, the LFM had an almost identical curve to most of the FMs for most user/item percentile groupings. This implies that, while adding more information to the models helped increase performance for the users/items with fewer interactions, this information was not necessary to achieve good performance overall, and so these models may be overly complex for the task.\n",

The LFM and FM models both generally outperformed every other model, especially at the lower end of the interaction spectrum where not enough data is known to make meaningful predictions. This makes these models quite effective at solving the cold start problem.\n",

    "Another interesting trend is that while every model generally improved when more interactions were incorporated into the model, there is a notable drop in performance across every model except the baselines when the rate of playership to ownership is in the middle of the range (especially in the 0.7-0.9 range). This could be due to a few reasons. When a user plays more games, the model has more information to consider what kinds of games the user plays - however, there could be a lot of noise in this data. Just because a user has played a game, doesn't necessarily mean that the user will play other games like it. It's also worth noting once again that games have very different lengths which lead to inconsistent playtime predictions. A more accurate measure might be the percentage of a game completed, but that cannot be extracted from this dataset."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while every model outperformed the baselines, the LFM had the best overall performance for this dataset. It is fast, flexible, and highly scalable. The factorization machine is a close second - it has the most potential to become extremely accurate, but at a great time and computational cost. It also requires a lot of hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "The factorization machine, though in a fairly optimized state, was likely not utilized to its fullest potential. For one, it would be worth testing a more typical gradient descent optimization algorithm, especially when the number of parameter updates increases. Much of the training time is spent on iterating through the dataset, so cutting down on redundant iterations could achieve better performance. It would also be interesting to see whether clusters of feature values could be more useful than the feature values themselves. There is a lot of overlap between different genres and tags, but utilizing more features increases the computational costs greatly. By combining features into a reduced representation, one could potentially incorporate much more information into the model."
